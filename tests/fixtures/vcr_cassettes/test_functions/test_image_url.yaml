        shows a fossilized skeleton of a prehistoric animal preserved in stone. The
        fossil is laid out on an elliptical slab that appears to be displayed under

        column, ribs, limbs, a tail, and a distinct skull with visible cranial and
        facial features. The posture of the skeleton suggests it was fossilized in
        a dormant or resting position, with the head turned towards the viewer. The

        into the anatomy and possible lifestyle of this creature when it was alive.","json_payload":null,"context":null,"cached":false}'
